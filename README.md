## Bread Dough Calculator

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that aims to ease bread dough calculations.

Tailwind CSS is used to make it look nice.

## Usage

Enter the amount of flour to be used. Other ingredient amounts are automatically calculated based on configurable percentages for each. 

The type of yeast to be used can be configured as well.

A toggle in the bottom right corner allows switching between English and Icelandic.
